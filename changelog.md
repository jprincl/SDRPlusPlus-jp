# Changelog

## v1.2.2-alpha3 - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Merged KiwiSDR support from SDRPlusPlusBrown by @sannysanoff.

### Changed

- Further steps to fork from upstream with `iak` branding so that the `iak` fork could live side by side with upstream SDR++ on the same system. Fixed Linux Debian packages broken by previous `iak`ization.
- Fix of default audio sink on Linux with ALSA audio API selected: Don't let the ALSA audio queue dry up if radio is stopped. The ALSA sink would not restart if the radio was paused and restarted.

## v1.2.2-alpha2 - 2026-04-19

### Changed

- Reworked high DPI display handling: The display DPI is newly respected.
- A new user display scaling factor now multiplies with the display native DPI scale.
- General clean-up of the UI scaling code to respect the display and user scaling factors.
- Expanded the touch region around the view splitters on Android so that they could be touched by thick fingers.

## v1.2.2-alpha1 - 2026-04-19

### Added

- Added Android audio rerouting when the preferred audio output changes.
- Added Ctrl+scroll waterfall bandwidth zooming.
- Added initial Android multi-touch support for waterfall zooming.

### Changed

- Updated CI artifact naming to include version information, commit distance, and commit hash from `git describe`.
- Added the `-iak` infix to release artifact names and to Linux Debian package naming to keep this fork isolated from upstream SDR++ packages.
- Reworked CI release handling to read version information from `version.h`.

### Fixed

- Fixed Android audio sink behavior by pausing and restarting audio output to work around devices that lock when the audio queue dries up.
