# SDR++ iak AppImage — Compatibility and Internals

The Linux AppImage produced by `docker_builds/appimage/` is a single,
self-contained executable that bundles all SDR-specific runtime
dependencies. It is built on Ubuntu 20.04 (focal) and targets a glibc
floor of **2.31**.

All file paths below are relative to the repository root.

---

## 1. Distros that work

The AppImage runs on any glibc ≥ 2.31 system with a working OpenGL/X11
stack and `libglfw3` installed.

| Distro | First release | glibc |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal) | 2020-04 | 2.31 (build target — exact floor) |
| Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (jammy) | 2022-04 | 2.35 |
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (noble) | 2024-04 | 2.39 |
| Debian 11 (bullseye) | 2021-08 | 2.31 |
| Debian 12 (bookworm) | 2023-06 | 2.36 |
| Debian 13 (trixie) | 2025 | 2.41 |
| Linux Mint 20+ | 2020-06 | 2.31 |
| Linux Mint 21+ | 2022-07 | 2.35 |
| Fedora 32+ | 2020-04 | 2.31+ |
| RHEL / Rocky / AlmaLinux 9 | 2022-05 | 2.34 |
| openSUSE Leap 15.4+ | 2022-06 | 2.31+ |
| Pop!_OS 20.04+ | 2020 | 2.31+ |
| Arch / Manjaro / EndeavourOS | rolling | latest |

## 2. Distros that do not work

The dynamic loader will fail with `version 'GLIBC_2.x' not found` on
these — there is no graceful error.

| Distro | glibc |
|---|---|
| Ubuntu 18.04 (bionic) | 2.27 |
| Debian 10 (buster) | 2.28 |
| RHEL / CentOS 7 | 2.17 |
| RHEL / CentOS / Rocky / Alma 8 | 2.28 |
| Linux Mint 19.x | 2.27 |
| openSUSE Leap 15.3 and earlier | 2.26 |

Anything older than ~early 2020 is below the floor.

## 3. Host-side requirements

These are deliberately **not** bundled — they couple to the user's GPU
drivers and X session, so bundling would break ABI compatibility.

* **OpenGL stack**: `libGL`, `libGLX`, `libEGL`, `libdrm`, vendor
  drivers (`nvidia`, `iris`, `radeonsi`, `nouveau`, …)
* **X11 stack**: `libX11`, `libxcb`, `libXext`, `libXrender`
* **GLFW**: `libglfw3` — must be installed on the host
* **glibc**: must be ≥ 2.31 on the host

The full exclusion list is in `docker_builds/appimage/make_appimage.sh`
under the `linuxdeploy --exclude-library` arguments.

### Installing libglfw3

The most common cause of "AppImage won't start" after the glibc floor
is a missing `libglfw3`. The custom `AppRun` (also in
`docker_builds/appimage/make_appimage.sh`) detects this before launch
and prints install commands:

```
Debian / Ubuntu / Mint:   sudo apt install libglfw3
Fedora / RHEL / Rocky:    sudo dnf install glfw
openSUSE:                 sudo zypper install libglfw3
Arch / Manjaro:           sudo pacman -S glfw
```

The detection uses `ldconfig -p` (with fallbacks to `/sbin/ldconfig`,
`/usr/sbin/ldconfig`, and a scan of common library directories) so it
works regardless of whether the user's `PATH` includes `/sbin`.

## 4. Wayland

The AppImage runs under XWayland on Wayland sessions (GNOME, KDE on
Wayland) without changes — GLFW falls back to X11. Native Wayland
would require building GLFW with Wayland support; not currently done.

## 5. Resource path resolution at runtime

The binary is compiled with `INSTALL_PREFIX="/usr"`, which means the
defaults in `core/src/core.cpp` for `modulesDirectory` and
`resourcesDirectory` point at `/usr/lib/sdrpp-iak/plugins` and
`/usr/share/sdrpp-iak`. On a host without an installed `.deb`, those
paths do not exist.

To handle this without touching the persisted config file, all reads
of those two paths go through accessors declared in
`core/src/core.h`:

```cpp
core::getModulesDirectory();
core::getResourcesDirectory();
```

The accessors are defined in `core/src/core.cpp`. Under
`#if defined(__linux__) && defined(BUILD_APPIMAGE)` they check
`$APPDIR` (set by the AppImage runtime to the FUSE mount point) and
return the bundled paths:

```
modulesDirectory   = $APPDIR/usr/lib/sdrpp-iak/plugins
resourcesDirectory = $APPDIR/usr/share/sdrpp-iak
```

Outside the AppImage build (vanilla `.deb`, Windows, macOS, Android),
the macro is undefined and the accessors compile to a one-liner that
just returns `configManager.conf[...]`. The AppImage build is enabled
by `-DOPT_BUILD_APPIMAGE=ON`, which the build script in
`docker_builds/appimage/make_appimage.sh` passes to CMake;
`core/CMakeLists.txt` propagates it as the `BUILD_APPIMAGE` compile
definition for `sdrpp_core`.

**Why accessors instead of mutating `conf`.** The `ConfigManager`
auto-saves the entire JSON document to disk on arbitrary UI changes.
Rewriting `conf["modulesDirectory"]` to a `$APPDIR`-prefixed value at
startup would persist a no-longer-valid FUSE mount path and break
subsequent `.deb` launches on the same machine. The accessor pattern
keeps the temporary mount path entirely in memory; the on-disk
config is never touched.

**Power-user override under AppImage.** Users cannot redirect
`modulesDirectory`/`resourcesDirectory` to a custom location while
running the AppImage — the accessors always win when `$APPDIR` is set.
This is intentional: bundled plugins ship matched to the bundled
`sdrpp_core` ABI, and a user-pointed plugin directory from a
different build would likely fail to load. If a real use case
appears, an env-var escape hatch (e.g. `SDRPP_IGNORE_APPDIR=1`) can
be added to the accessors.

## 6. CI integration

* Reusable workflow: `.github/workflows/build_appimage.yml`
* Matrix entries in `.github/workflows/build_all.yml` produce x86_64
  (`ubuntu-latest`) and aarch64 (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`) AppImages.
* Output filenames embed the full version, e.g.
  `sdrpp-iak-1.2.3+45-gabc1234-linux-x86_64.AppImage`.
* On PRs, the AppImage matrix is gated on the `detect_changes` job —
  it only runs when files that affect AppImage layout change
  (appimage scripts, root + core CMakeLists, `sdrpp_module.cmake`,
  `core/src/core.cpp`, the desktop file, the icon resource).
* On master pushes, tag pushes, and `workflow_dispatch`, AppImages
  are always built and included in `create_full_archive`,
  `update_nightly_release`, and `create_release`.

## 7. Bumping the glibc floor

To extend reach to RHEL 8 / CentOS 7 / Linux Mint 19 holdouts, change
the base image in `docker_builds/appimage/Dockerfile` from
`ubuntu:focal` to a distro with older glibc — e.g. Debian 10 (2.28)
or, more aggressively, a manylinux-style CentOS 7 container (2.17).

Cost is non-trivial: the SDR-specific build dependencies
(`libairspyhf-dev`, `liblimesuite-dev`, `libcodec2-dev`, `libvolk2-dev`,
…) are at older versions or not packaged at all on those bases. Worth
doing only if users actually ask for it.
