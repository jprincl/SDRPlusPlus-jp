# libmirisdr-5 (ericek111 fork) builds two utility executables alongside the
# library: miri_sdr and miri_fm. miri_fm.c includes <pthread.h>, which isn't
# on the include path under MSVC (FindThreads only sets the link library, not
# the include path). SDR++ only needs the library, so disable both utilities
# here rather than wiring up an include-path workaround.
