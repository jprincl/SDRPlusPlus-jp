# Patches libperseus-sdr's CMakeLists.txt:
#   1. Drops the explicit SHARED keyword from add_library(perseus-sdr ...) so
#      the library type follows BUILD_SHARED_LIBS. Without this, the dep
#      always builds shared even when the policy resolves to static (per
#      DepClassification.cmake, libperseus-sdr is static on every profile),
#      producing perseus-sdr.dll + an import lib named perseus-sdr.lib that
#      the validator correctly flags as a static/shared mismatch (same issue
#      libfobos had before its own patch landed).
#   2. Appends install rules — upstream ships none, so cmake --target install
#      would otherwise fail with "unknown target 'install'".
