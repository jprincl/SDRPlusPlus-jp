# Patches libfobos's CMakeLists.txt:
#   1. Removes the hardcoded CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX so our destdir prefix is used.
#   2. Removes the bundled libusb-1.0.dll install rule (libusb is built
#      separately by dep_libusb).
#   3. Drops the explicit SHARED keyword from add_library(fobos ...) so the
#      library type follows BUILD_SHARED_LIBS. Without this, libfobos always
#      builds shared even when the dep policy resolves to static (the
#      classification in deps/cmake/DepClassification.cmake marks libfobos
#      static on every profile), producing fobos.dll + an import lib named
#      fobos.lib that the validator correctly flags as a static/shared
#      mismatch.
#   4. Applies the generic PkgConfig stub (idempotent).
